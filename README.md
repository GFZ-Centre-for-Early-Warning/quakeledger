Quakeledger
----------------


This is a rewrite from 
https://github.com/GFZ-Centre-for-Early-Warning/quakeledger

and 

https://github.com/bpross-52n/quakeledger


The main difference is that this code is refactored and uses a sqlite database.

The data importet are the valparaiso\_v1.3.csv file as events table,
the sites.csv as sites table and the
mean\_disagg.csv as mean\_disagg table.
